# project_work
Main.java: This is the entry point of your application. It initializes the necessary components and starts the user interface.
algorithms/: This directory contains classes responsible for implementing the algorithms used in the transportation problem.
DistanceCalculator.java: Implements the Vogel Approximation Method or any other distance calculation algorithm.
ArrivalTimeCalculator.java: Implements the Critical Path Method or any other algorithm for estimating arrival times.
models/: This directory contains classes that represent the data structures used in the application.
Location.java: Represents a location on the UG campus, storing information like name, coordinates, and landmarks.
utils/: This directory contains utility classes for handling map API integration, sorting algorithms, and other helper functions.
MapAPI.java: Integrates with a map API (e.g., Google Maps) to obtain actual distances between locations.
SortingAlgorithm.java: Implements a sorting algorithm (e.g., QuickSort or MergeSort) to sort distances or arrival times.
views/: This directory contains classes related to the user interface of the application.
UserInterface.java: Handles user input and output, displays menus, and interacts with the algorithms and models.
